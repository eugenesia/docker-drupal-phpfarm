Docker Drupal PHPFarm
=====================

This creates a Docker image for developing a Drupal 7 site.

Using [PHPFarm](https://github.com/eugenesia/docker-phpfarm) means you can use
multiple PHP versions for the site - good for developing multiple client sites
running different PHP versions on their servers.
